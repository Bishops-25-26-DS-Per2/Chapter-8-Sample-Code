# Chapter 8 Sample Code

  1. In class on Friday, February 6, we looked at examples 1, 2c and 4 from the `cpp` folder [here](https://github.com/TBSDrJ/Passing_to_functions_c_cpp).  These show the difference between passing by value vs. passing by reference in C++.  Passing by reference is not available in C.  You can also see more details about these in the PDF in this repo; there are summary notes in the Blackbaud Topics page from the whiteboard in class.  We will talk about passing by pointer later after we spend a little more time talking about what a pointer is.
  1. In a workshop on our Professional Development day, I made an AI-powered notebook about the PDF document of how to pass things to functions in C and C++.  It includes a 16 minutes podcast description of the dcoument, which you can make interactive (yes, you can interrupt the podcast and ask questions), an inforgraphic and so on. [That is here.](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/4ae7ef8c-68cf-45f5-b0f7-c62edfd3932e) This needs permission to access, I manually added everyone in the class to that list, so you have to be logged into your Bishop's account to access the Notebook version.
  1. In class on Tuesday, February 10, we talked about scope, and illustrated this with the examples seen in `scope.cpp` above.  This is all the same in C as it is in C++.
  1. In class on Thursday, Feb 12, we practiced writing a couple of functions in the parabola examples above.  Then, we looked at how to use a C++ `array` object, which has an interface that is kind of similar to a Python `list`.  There is also a `list` object in C++ with a similar interface.
  1. In class on Wednesday, Feb 18, we looked at C-style `array`s, and how to generate random numbers in C and C++.
  1. In class on Thursday, Feb 19, I showed a few tricks and tips that may help you with your 2048 lab.  Note: I posted a new version of the Lab Handout with some added test rows because the tests in the earlier version were insufficient.
