# Chapter 8 Sample Code

  1. In class on Friday, February 6, we looked at examples 1, 2c and 4 from the `cpp` folder [here](https://github.com/TBSDrJ/Passing_to_functions_c_cpp).  These show the difference between passing by value vs. passing by reference in C++.  Passing by reference is not available in C.  You can also see more details about these in the PDF in this repo; there are summary notes in the Blackbaud Topics page from the whiteboard in class.  We will talk about passing by pointer later after we spend a little more time talking about what a pointer is.
  1. In class on Tuesday, February 10, we talked about scope, and illustrated this with the examples seen in `scope.cpp` above.  This is all the same in C as it is in C++.
